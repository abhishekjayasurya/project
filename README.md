## The Assignment
Maven Roasters is a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City. To better understand the purchase behavior and streamline operations, I have collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023. My goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.
